  "body": "drupalspinner\r\n=============\r\n\r\nDrupal Spinner (a.k.a. makeisland) is a tool to spin up new drupal\r\nmulti-site instances that have islandora in place and configured to\r\nuse a common Fedora et al install.\r\n\r\nThis tool relies on a particular approach to drupal\r\nmulti-site. There needs to be a primary drupal site that's used as the\r\nshared/canonical source for all user info (username, passwords, auth\r\ninfo, etc.) and which has the islandora modules installed (though the\r\nsite need not have them activated - the modules just need to be in the\r\nsites/all tree). Each new island (i.e. new drupal multi-site) looks to\r\nthe primary site tables for user data.\r\n\r\nThis tool uses drush and bash script to create the new islands, so\r\ndrush needs to be installed.\r\n\r\nThere are 4.5 main parts to the tool:\r\n      DEFAULT_SETTINGS.txt - the template settings file that's used for each island (this is shared here as an example file)\r\n      ISLAND.ROOT.cfg - a bunch of configuration data that's common to all islands (this is shared here as an example file)\r\n      ISLAND.site.islandname.cfg - configuration data specific to islandname (i.e. one of these exists for each island)\r\n      (ISLAND.BASE.cfg) - an example/template for a specific ISLAND.islandname.cfg file)\r\n      makeisland - the bash script that does all the work\r\n\r\nTo spin up a new islandora-enabled site:\r\n\r\n0.a) make sure all the islandora modules are correctly installed (not necessarily activated) in the base site; you only need to do this the first time (i.e. this is part of setting up the base drupal install)\r\n0.b) make sure the drupalspinner has all the base data it needs (copy ISLAND.ROOT.cfg.example to ISLAND.ROOT.cfg and edit all the appropriate settings in that file)\r\n\r\n1) copy ISLAND.BASE.cfg to a new file called ISLAND.site.mynewsite.cfg, where mynewsite is the (computer) name of your new site\r\n2) edit ISLAND.mynewsite.cfg to fill in the appropriate values\r\n3) $ makeisland mynewsite\r\n\r\nand that should be it.\r\n\r\nTODO: expand and refine this file / instructions\r\n\r\n\r\n",
